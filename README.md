# Skyra.PW

## Setup/Contributing Guide

To run the dashboard locally, you'll need a local version of Skyra running. Make sure you
have the following constants defined in your `config.ts`: CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI.

After forking/cloning this repo to a folder locally:

1. Navigate to `src/meta/constants.js` and change `CLIENT_ID` to the bot you're using.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
3. `yarn start`
